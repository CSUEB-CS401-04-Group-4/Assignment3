StringUtils Project

Overview

StringUtilsTestConcatenate:
    To develop a utility class (StringUtils) with methods for string manipulations such as concatenation, reversal, conversion to uppercase, and trimming of whitespace. 
    The project also involves validating these methods using JUnit parameterized tests.


StringUtils Methods:
  concatenate(String str1, String str2): Combines two strings, handling null inputs as empty strings.
  reverse(String str): Reverses the characters in a string.
  toUpperCase(String str): Converts all characters in a string to uppercase.
  trim(String str): Removes leading and trailing whitespace from a string.

Testing Strategy
    Parameterized Tests: Used to validate each method under various conditions.
Test Coverage:
    Concatenate: Tested with different combinations of null and non-null strings.
    Reverse: Included tests for empty, single character, and multi-character strings.
    ToUpperCase: Covered cases with mixed-case inputs, including numbers and special characters.
    Trim: Focused on strings with varying amounts of whitespace, including tabs and new lines.

Test Execution and Results
  Execution: Tests were run using the JUnit test runner in IntelliJ IDEA.
Results:
  Total Tests Executed: 24 (6 for each method)
  Tests Passed: 24
  Tests Failed: 0
  Success Rate: 100%

  Conclusion
The StringUtils project successfully implemented essential string manipulation utilities with high reliability, 
as evidenced by the comprehensive test coverage and 100% pass rate. The project adheres to best practices in software development, 
including effective error handling and rigorous testing.
